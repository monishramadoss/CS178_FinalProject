# Chart Ideas
I. Words used vs error rate


# Rubric
1. Technical effort - 60 points
Problem definition - Is the problem clearly defined and does the formulation make sense? - 10 points
Approach -  Is a baseline tested and compared?  Is there a review of existing methods to solve the same/similar problem? Based on what already exists, how is this approach/experiment justified? - 15 points
Data - Are standard (freely available and/or used by existing methods) datasets used in experiments? If preprocessing was needed, was it performed in a unbiased form? If a custom dataset was made, then was the data analyzed to be non-biased, non-noisy, rich in variety? - 10 points
Experiments - Are the experiments performed systematic and follow acceptable ML practices? Are the results depicted in concrete form (visualizations/tables that show true performance for the whole test dataset)? Are the results quantitatively compared to the existing methods using standard matrices? - 15 points
Analysis - Is there an analysis of the achieved results/contributions and why it worked/not worked? And how it can be improved? - 10 points
2. Project report - 25 points
Is it organized, clear, and free of spelling/grammar errors? - 10 points
Are the main contributions/failures stated clearly? - 5 points
Citations and bibliography - Are all relevant resources/papers and used softwares/libraries etc. properly cited? - 10 points
3. Poster Presentation - 15 points
Did the oral poster presentation clearly communicate the problem/context, goals, approach, results, contributions? - 10 points
Was it visually appealing? - 5 points
